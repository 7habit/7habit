### What is 7Habit
The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is a self-improvement book by Stephen Covey. It introduces a holistic, integrated, and principle-centered approach for solving personal and professional problems. The 7 habits are a set of behaviors that can help people become more effective in work and life.
