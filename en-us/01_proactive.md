## Once there was a child
Ma was born into an ordinary middle class family. Both parents have stable jobs that provide basic financial security. The family atmosphere is warm, and both parents are very caring and supportive of the pony's development.

Since childhood, Pony has shown a lively, cheerful and optimistic personality. He loved to laugh, to be outdoors, and to be curious to explore the world.

Ponies form friendships easily with others and are willing to help those in need. This is reflected in his performance in kindergarten and primary school. Influenced by teachers and classmates, he learned how to share and help others.

They are not afraid to try new things, join various interest groups and sports teams, and strive to explore their potential and interests. This gives him the opportunity to experiment and grow in different fields.

Although Ma has a cheerful personality, he is also very serious and responsible, especially in his study. He has shown a love and seriousness for learning since primary school and this has continued into university. It makes him an excellent student.

## Twenty years of confusion
At the age of three, he entered kindergarten and began to play with more friends. Under the influence of his teachers and classmates, Ma learned to share and help others. A year later, Ma successfully entered primary school and began to study seriously. Pony likes Chinese and science, and both his teachers and parents are pleased with his progress.

After junior high school, Xiao Ma began to develop an interest in games and electronic products, but he also managed his time appropriately and did not interfere with his studies. With the encouragement of his teachers, Ma joined sports teams and interest groups on campus, where he found his potential and interests.

In high school, Ma became more independent and began to make plans for his future. He wants to go to a university where he can study science and technology professionally and hopes to become an engineer after graduation. With the support of his teachers and family, Ma was admitted to his ideal university.

During the four years of college, Ma studied hard and participated in various extracurricular activities to broaden his horizon and develop his skills. Eventually, Ma graduated and found an engineering job that interested him.

## At a loss for another decade
At first, the job was full of challenges and novelty. Ma worked hard to become a qualified engineer and gradually got familiar with it. At the same time, he has formed friendships with his new colleagues, and everything about his work is something to look forward to.

However, after three years, Ma began to feel that the work became repetitive and boring, and it was difficult to achieve a sense of accomplishment. In addition, the salary increase is far less than expected, Ma gradually produced career development confusion.

At this time, the pony's two high school friends have started a successful business, to live the life they want. The little horse was very envious and began to think about what he wanted. Stay in your current job or start a business as a friend. The bewilderment that greeted him brought him to his first low point.

Ma began to ponder the meaning of life and self-pursuit alone, repeatedly weighing different options, but still unable to decide. These days, the pony became silent and seldom kept company with others. His parents and friends were worried about his state.

Until one day, his mother encouraged him to re-examine his interests and expertise and do something he loved. Ma finally realized that what really mattered was not the expectations of the outside world, but doing something interesting and meaningful for himself.

Ma decided to go back to college, study psychology and become a child psychologist. It was a job that played to his strengths and helped others. The pony who has resumed his learning is full of enthusiasm and walking on the road of exploring life.

Three years later, Ma completely quit her previous job and became a qualified child psychologist. The sense of accomplishment and joy he felt when he helped his first child client convinced him that this was the life he wanted.

Looking back on life, Ma realized that the true meaning of life is not how much success, but whether you have the courage to go your own way, to find your own career and life. Now he lives a simple and happy life, knowing that he is ready for whatever lies ahead.

This kind of life is the essence of Pony's 30 years.
